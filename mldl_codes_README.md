In this repository I tried to link some of my Machine learning-Heart Disease analysis using Logistic Regression,SVM,Random Forest,KNN algorithms.
The aim was to compare and analysis the difference between these Machine Learning algorithms in Heart Disease tabular dataset.
Data preprocessing and feature selection was also done for improving the performance.
